Synthesizer Task list

** DONE Control notes with a text file
** DONE Smooth transitions between graphs
Either:
*** duplicate the graph, fade out the old, fade in the new
*** mutate the graph, fade between altered nodes
** DONE Comment out lines in the text file
** DONE Choose oscillator for each note from the text file
** DONE Configure oscillator from the text file (e.g. square wave duty cycle)
** DONE treat all parameters as signals
** DONE Describe a graph from the text file
** DONE Add proper envelope to lisp
** DONE Add support for custom interpolation types to the envelope effect
** DONE Support including other script files
** DONE custom s-expression read+eval
*** DONE skeleton for parser
*** DONE define and implement a basic type system
** DONE add support for feedback
** TODO Support building instruments from Welsh's Synthesizer Cookbook
*** DONE Low-pass Filter with cutoff and resonance parameters
*** TODO Envelope for LPF
** DONE quality of life special forms
*** DONE and/or
*** DONE let
** TODO add a file picker to the UI
** TODO infrastructure to make it easier to export functions to lisp
** TODO Transition between graphs by mutating the graph and fading between altered nodes
** TODO implement a REPL mode, making live changes to the graph rather than replacing it
** TODO Describe dynamic note changes in the text file
*** DONE add support for an envelope signal generator
*** TODO tools for sequencer
** TODO music theory libraries
** TODO lisp language improvements
*** TODO include whitespace and comment information in output from reader
This allows us to modify the AST programmatically and output a file
retaining comments and formatting.
** TODO Refactor code out of app.go
** TODO features for adoption and usability
*** TODO discoverability of capabilities
*** TODO usability of capabilities
*** TODO instrumentation of live usage
** TODO model for namespaces and packages
** TODO Todos from GPT-3
