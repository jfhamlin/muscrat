;; Test trigger functionality with different waveforms
;; The trigger should stabilize the waveform display at the specified level

;; Low frequency sine wave - easy to see trigger effect
(def slow-sine (sin 2))
(scope slow-sine :name "2Hz Sine - Trigger Test")

;; Square wave - sharp transitions make trigger points clear
(def square-wave (square 5))
(scope square-wave :name "5Hz Square - Trigger Test")

;; Sawtooth wave - linear ramp shows trigger clearly
(def saw-wave (saw 3))
(scope saw-wave :name "3Hz Saw - Trigger Test")

;; Complex waveform - AM modulation
(let [carrier (sin 100)
      modulator (sin 0.5)
      am-signal (mul carrier (add 1 (mul 0.5 modulator)))]
  (scope am-signal :name "AM Signal - Trigger Test")
